1.  fetch api: The Fetch API in JavaScript is a modern interface for making HTTP requests to servers from web browsers. 
    It provides a more powerful and flexible replacement for XMLHttpRequest (XHR). 
    The fetch() method is used to request data from a server and requires only one parameter: the URL to request. 
    It returns a promise that resolves into a Response object containing the fetched data.

2.  blob of data:  blob refers to a file-like object of immutable, 
    raw data that can be read as text or binary data, or converted 
    into a ReadableStream for processing the data.
