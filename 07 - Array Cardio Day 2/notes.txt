1.  Adding {} around a variable name when using console.log() creates an object with the variable name 
    as the key and the value of the variable as the value. This can make it easier to identify the 
    variable being logged when viewing the output in the console.
    This can be helpful when you are logging multiple variables, as it provides context for the logged 
    values.
